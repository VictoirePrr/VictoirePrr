# Hi there, I'm Victoire! 👋✨  

I'm a student at **42 Lyon**, diving deep into low-level programming and algorithmic challenges. I love solving problems, optimizing code, and exploring how things work under the hood. 🛠️  

## 📌 Completed Projects  

### 🔹 **Libft** – My Own C Standard Library  
Rewriting essential C functions from scratch! No more relying on `strlen` or `malloc`—I built my own.  

### 📜 **Get Next Line** – Reading Files, One Line at a Time  
A function that reads from a file descriptor and returns a line—perfect for handling large files without memory leaks! 📖  

### 🖨️ **ft_printf** – My Very Own Printf  
Recreating `printf` from scratch! It supports various conversions (`%d`, `%s`, `%x`...), formatted output, and is super efficient. 🦾  

### 🎮 **so_long** – My First 2D Game  
Using **MiniLibX**, I created a simple top-down game with a cute character navigating through a maze. Pixel art, movement mechanics, and game logic—this was such a fun project!  

### 🌀 **Push_swap** – Sorting with Style  
Sorting numbers with only two stacks and a limited set of operations. 🚀 I implemented various sorting algorithms and optimized for **efficiency and minimal moves**!  

## 🔧 Currently Working On  

### 🔗 **Pipex** – Mastering Inter-Process Communication  
I’m currently learning how processes talk to each other using **pipes**! This project simulates shell behavior by executing chained commands with redirections. 🔄💡
